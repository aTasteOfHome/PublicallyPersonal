			<h3>What's My Story</h3>
			<p>
				It's a big question to ask, when you think about it. Somehow, these few short paragraphs in a cozy little corner of the internet will contain all that I am, all that I was, and all that I hope to be. But you came here for a story, so I'll tell a short tale for your troubles.
			</p>
			<br>
			<p>
				I remember running away from home when I was 9 or 10. The details escape me, but I vaguely recall an existential crisis of sorts, along with heated mentions of "bedtime" and "no astronomy." Whatever the reason, it was late, my parents were arguing in the other room over
				how best to impresss upon me the benefits of a good night's sleep, and I was out the door, running as fast and as far as my little legs would take me.
			</p>
			<p>
				I didn't get very far, but I did make it to the edge of a nearby lake. It was dark, and scary, and I was feeling very small and alone, with nothing but crickets to keep me company.
			</p>
			<p>
				After a while, though, I noticed lights from the houses on the other side of the lake, and I thought of how much they looked like the stars I would watch through my telescope. I thought about how each one had its own Andrews and Andreas, Moms and Dads. Some stars were big, with many lights, and others small; Some were bright and happy, some tired and dim. Some were close, and yet others were far, far, away. But every star had a story to tell: all I had to do was watch, and listen.
			</p>
			<p>
				And so I did. I've befriended a man who's become a legend in the small city he calls home, making a living off the street by playing music for passersby the past 30 years. I've talked with a cabbie from Syria, who told me of how his brothers found themselves on either side of the battlefield, one as a freedom fighter, and the other as a conscript of Asaad. I've had dinner with a self-described "Sex Positive Feminist with a capital S-P-F" whose passion for human rights is matched only by her love of the finer points of Markov chain implementations. And, a long time ago, I took lessons from a music teacher who kept a picture of her family, long gone, on a nightstand next to the piano. In time, should you choose to contact me, I will tell you of how I resolved server downtimes through daily meetings and agenda updates, of how I took the initiative to teach myself modern web development frameworks and languages to build this website, and other stories filled with pertinent, career-related jargon. I do have a job to do, and I intend to do it well. But for now, I'd like you to take a deep breath and look at the points of light sitting around you, each with a story of their own. And one day, should you choose to take me in, I'd like to hear yours.

				Best,
				<br>
				Andrew Tsai
